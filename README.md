# IPT Reactive Java IoT Demo

Sensor data is streamed in realtime from Arduino + accelerometeres, gyroscopes & compass 3D, ultrasound distance sensor, etc. using UDP protocol. The data processing is done with reactive Java alterantive implementations: callbacks, CompletableFutures and using Spring 5 Reactor library. The web 3D visualization with Three.js is streamed using Server Sent Events (SSE).

A video for the IoT demo is available @YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB3AWAfcy9U 

The presentation is available @SlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Trayan_Iliev/ipt-reactive-java-iot-demo-bgoug-2018

There are more reactive Java demos in the same repository - callbacks, CompletableFuture, realtime event streaming. Soon I'll add a description how to build the device and upload Arduino sketch, as well as describe CompletableFuture and Reactor demos and 3D web visualization part with Three.js. Please stay tuned :)ï»¿
